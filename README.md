**Overview**

This was one of my first exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects.
I used Python,Pandas,NumPy,Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore India’s EV charging station dataset.
My aim was to understand how charging stations are spread across states and how charger power (kW) varies across the country.

**Data Cleaning**

Removed duplicate rows and missing values

Fixed spelling mistakes in state names and made them consistent

Filled missing charger power (kW) values using the median

**Data Analysis & Visualization**

Found that Maharashtra, Delhi, and Karnataka have the most EV charging stations

Most chargers were Slow (≤7.4 kW) followed by AC Fast and a few DC Fast chargers

Created bar charts and pie charts to visualize station counts and power levels

Plotted latitude and longitude to see how stations are spread across India

Used a correlation heatmap to find relationships between numeric columns

**Key Insights**

Around 63% of chargers are slow - still early stage for fast charging in India

Industrial and metro states (like Delhi and Maharashtra) have stronger EV infrastructure

Charger speed doesn’t depend much on location — mostly on investment and network growth

**Conclusion**

India’s EV charging setup is growing fast but still uneven.
Metro areas are improving quickly, while some central and northeast regions need more attention.
This project gave me a good understanding of how to clean,visualize and interpret real-world data.
